Project Abstract
<br>
Using the PASSNYC data, we examined New York City schools across a number of different factors. Within the data we have information about the performance of students in schools using the metrics of ELA (English Language Arts) Proficiency and Math Proficiency. We want to understand why certain schools perform well and how to improve the performance of those that donâ€™t. A primary factor to consider is School Estimate Income, or the Average Household Income, of families within these schools. An assumption can be made that those schools with higher average incomes perform better, but is this actually the case? It is important that we as a society make sure that students from varied backgrounds have the ability to compete. Should schools that have a greater economic need be funded more to help foster better learning environments? We also will look at the Student Absence Rate and how that correlates to economic need and performance. In schools where absence rates are greater, do the students suffer academically? In order to create a better learning environment, schools should have strong leaders, rigorous instruction, collaborative teachers, and community ties; especially in schools that are underperforming. We have examined 1272 schools including public and charter schools to determine the differentiating factors of high and low performance.
